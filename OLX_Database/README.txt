MILESTONE 2:

In the CSV_Files folder you will find all the csv files used to make the sql database. olx.csv is the main csv file in which rows were extracted to make the rest of the csvs.

In the "Cleaners" folder you will find two codes I created in python. mrclean is used to manipulate the columns and remove \n as well as commas to create the rest of the csvs, mrgenerate is used to populate the rest of the csvs which are not obtained from olx.
In Olxscaper you will find all the files I used to scrape olx, but for you convience I created a folder called "scripts" which contain the two relevant parts as the rest was generated by scrapy, but do note in order to actually run the code you will need to use the original olxscraper folder as well as your own cookies for olx.

Finally you will find a screenshots folder which contains 3 screenshots showcasing that the arabic words worked in sql.
