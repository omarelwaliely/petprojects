When I ran this the executable worked on my computer but not other computers (the search engine would not display results)

If this happens open project.cpp and make sure the text files directories are correct on your computer, and in any case as long as the project.cpp is in the same folder as everything else, running in the compiler, ie: visual studios, should work. (It is only one cpp file)

The code is commented on throughout, except for the page rank algorithm because the code is commented out due to you not needing the majority of it anymore, if you want to see the comments just open "pagerankcomments.txt".

"temp.txt" was the first ever generated pr file and isn't needed at all unless you want a clean slate then you can change it to "temp.csv"

The lab report is found in "Analysis_of_search_engine.pdf", in this folder and could also be found in the submission on blackboard.

Test1,2,3, and 4 are example runs and can be removed from the folder as well

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy this search engine project by Omar Elwaliely
